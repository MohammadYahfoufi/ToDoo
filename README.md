## 🧠 What Makes ToDoo Unique?

- Designed for both quick entries and deep planning.

### 💬 Discussion Board  
- An in-app space to **discuss useful, life-enhancing topics** — like routines, motivation, deep work, and mental wellness.
- Not your usual social feed filled with memes and noise.
- This is **a place for focused minds**, not distractions.

### ⏱️ Built-In Focus Timer

- You’ll feel more present and less overwhelmed.

## 🎯 Why This App Was Made

**Most productivity apps only solve one problem: organizing tasks.**  
ToDoo solves a bigger problem: **building the mindset behind staying productive.**

This app was born out of the frustration of seeing people drown in endless scrolling, chatting about nothing, or mindlessly switching between tabs. ToDoo brings everything into one quiet, powerful space:

- **Tasks to take action.**  
- **Timers to stay disciplined.**  
- **Conversations to grow wiser.**

It’s like social media — if social media made you better.
